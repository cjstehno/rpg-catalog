I am attempting to catalog the scope of RPGs, *as I know them*.

This is intended to be a reference for my personal use, but I figured I would share so that others could benefit from what I've gathered.

This catalog is presented as an [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/) managed with Git, and stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/cjstehno/rpg-catalog). If you're not Git-savvy, I recommend just [downloading](https://github.com/cjstehno/rpg-catalog/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the vault and opening it with Obsidian.

> I would ***love*** to be able to generate a standalone wiki site based on this content, but I am not going to pay for the services that I know about, nor am I going to put much time into writing my own - suggestions welcome.

I am open to edits and/or additions, but only through GitHub Issue tickets - just create one and make your suggestion. If I like it, I will make the change(s), otherwise, you are free to fork the repo and do your own thing.
